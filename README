NAME

    Task::Lyrics::Fetcher - install all known-to-work Lyrics::Fetcher
    fetchers

SYNOPSIS

    A quick way to install Lyrics::Fetcher and a selection of
    Lyrics::Fetcher::* modules for various services which are currently
    known to work. Over time, newly-added and tested Fetcher modules will
    be added to this Task, and any which no longer work (because the site
    they talk to no longer exists, or has changed in a way they can no
    longer operate with it) will be removed.

    Perl one liner using CPAN.pm:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Task::Lyrics::Fetcher'

    Use of CPAN.pm in interactive mode:

      $> perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install Task::Lyrics::Fetcher
      cpan> quit

    Using cpanminus:

      $> cpanm Task::Lyrics::Fetcher
